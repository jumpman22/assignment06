//STEP 1 Create an application that prompts the user for a number. Regardless of whether they enter a negative or positive number, make sure to display the positive version of that number in the console window. If I enter -15 in the prompt and -15 is displayed in the console window, you did this one wrong.
//var number = window.prompt("Enter a postive or negative number");
//window.alert(Math.abs(number));

//STEP 2 Create an application that prompts the user for a floating point value (decimal). Store the result of that input in a variable and then round it up to the nearest whole number. Display the result within a console window.
//var num = window.prompt("Enter a number with a decimal");
//window.alert(Math.round(num));

//STEP 3 Create an application that prompts the user for a floating point value (decimal). Store the result of that input in a variable and then round it down to the nearest whole number. Display the result within a console window.
//var num = window.prompt("Enter a number with a decimal");
//window.alert(Math.floor(num));

//STEP 4 Create an application that prompts the user for 5 numbers. Ask them to comma delimit each number so you get 1,2,3,4,5 for example. Store the result of that input in a variable and then find the largest and smallest numbers in that list. Display both of those numbers within a console window.
//var numbers = window.prompt("Enter 5 numbers separated with commas - ex. 1,2,3,4,5");
//var new_numbers = numbers.split(",").map(Number);
//
//var max = new_numbers.reduce(function(a, b) {
//    return Math.max(a, b);
//});
//
//var min = new_numbers.reduce(function(a, b) {
//    return Math.min(a, b);
//});
//
//window.console.log("The largest number was " + max + "\nThe smallest number was " + min);

//STEP 5 Create an application that prompts the user for a number. Now find the square root of that number and display the result within a console window. 
//var num = window.prompt("Enter a number");
//var sqrt = Math.sqrt(num);
//window.console.log("The square of root " + num + " is " + sqrt);
