//Solve the following string/math/number/function/array-related problems. Each solution should be written within its own function and the output should be //displayed within a console window. The display should be the return value of the function call.

//STEP 1 Write a JavaScript function that returns a passed string with letters in alphabetical order. Assume punctuation and number symbols are not included in the passed-in string.
//Sample Data and Output
//Example string: 'webmaster'

function alphabetize(str) {
    "use strict";
    str.split("").sort().join("");
}
alphabetize("webmaster");
