//STEP 1 Create an application that gets the number of days in a month. Display that result within the console window.
//var current_month = new Date().getMonth() + 1;
//if(current_month === 1 || current_month === 3 || current_month === 5 || current_month ===7 || current_month === 8 || current_month === 10 || current_month === 12) {
//  window.console.log("There are 31 days this month");  
//} else if(current_month === 2 ) {
//  window.console.log("There are 28 days this month");
//} else {
//  window.console.log("There are 30 days this month");
//}

//STEP 2 Create an application that gets the month name from a particular date. Display that result within the console window.
//var months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
//var current_month = new Date().getMonth();
//window.console.log("The current month is " + months[current_month]);

//STEP 3 Create an application that tests whether a date is a weekend. Display that result within the console window.
//var current_day = new Date().getDay();
//if(current_day === 0 || current_day === 6) {
//    window.console.log("Today is a weekend date");
//} else {
//    window.console.log("Today is not a weekend date");
//}

//STEP 4 Create an application that gets yesterdayâ€™s day of the week. For instance, if today is Tuesday, the console window should display Monday. 
//var days = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
//var yday = new Date().getDay() - 1;
//window.console.log("Yesterday was " + days[yday]);

//STEP 5 Create an application that gets the current day of the week. The twist here is that I want only the first letter of the day. If today is Tuesday, the letter T should be displayed in the console window.
//var days = ["S", "M", "T", "W", "T", "F", "S"];
//var current_day = new Date().getDay();
//window.console.log(days[current_day]);
